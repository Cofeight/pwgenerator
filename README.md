Password Generator

I defined the constants to be utilized and implelemented a function to work through the required parameters. Alerts  were provided on each iteration to the user if input did not meet the requirements. I also included an additional copy button function for improved usability. I'd like to improve functionality, and recognize that I could provide cleaner javascript code to keep things as DRY as possible.
